<p>In HTML, you define a paragraph using the &lt;p&gt; element.</p>

<!--
In HTML, the characters <, >, ", ', and & are special characters. They are parts of the HTML syntax itself.
Each character reference starts with an ampersand (&), and ends with a semicolon (;).

Literal character	  Character reference equivalent
